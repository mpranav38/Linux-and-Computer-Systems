 This project aims to teach you the basics of Linux and Virtual Machines, as well as some basic Q&A about
 computer systems. Any programming you do in this assignment will be limited to BASH scripting and/or
 Python. You can use any computer for this part of the assignment (e.g. your laptop running any OS).
 Here is your assignment. Collect evidence of your work through screen shots and log files. You will write
 a report at the end that outlines what you have done to complete this assignment.


 
 1. Setup VM, Linux, and basic testing â€“ must take screen shots at each step to receive
 points
 a. Read Oracle VirtualBox White Paper
 b. Download Oracle Virtu
 c. Install VirtualBox
 d. Download Ubuntu 
 e. Create Virtual Machine (VM), to support Linux, Ubuntu, 64-bit, 4GB RAM, Virtual Disk
 25GB, VDI image, dynamically allocated, 2-core, and a network interface (1GbE or WiFi)
 with NAT support
 f. Install Linux from the ISO image
 g. Create a user id and password
 h. Turn on Firewall and block all ports
 i.Enable SSH access to your new Linux installation; open SSH port in firewall
 j.Repeat steps 5 through 9, and create another VM with the same specifications as the
 first one
 k. Create private/public keys and install them properly in both of your new VMs
 l.Test that you can connect remotely to your VMs with your keys, from one VM to the
 other VM



 3. (13 points) Show an example of using the following commands (hint: you can use man to find
 more information about each one); take screen shots of your commands; make sure to clear the
 screen between each command; explain in your own words what these commands do:
